# SSH Phase 2 Implementation Progress

- Updated: 2026-09-19
- PR: [#832](https://github.com/WayfarerLabs/agentworks/pull/832), draft
- Evaluated code: `e63a1ec4a8e9d99e89d09d6b162e908d3a4b96d6`
- Main/contract base: `cea5e8523aac05edfc3a99a940d7cfb4d71fe32f` (#830)
- State: Independent policy and forwarding increment validated locally; full integration remains
  open

## Implemented scope

The new SSH adapter now has additive passive operator settings, shared isolated client policy,
explicit raw/managed trust, fresh per-operation admission, identity companion validation and owned
local forwarding. Four `config` commands expose complete-policy import, inspection, blocking and
refresh without loading operator configuration or the database. Existing callers remain unchanged.

Enrollment retains one candidate per stable resource creation identity. It verifies a first-contact
acknowledgment with a separate strict connection, supports only strict recovery against the same
active policy generation and leaves publication explicit. The receipt is evidence, not a new
ordinary connection. Production creation provenance and complete-policy publication binding remain
transport's responsibility.

Permanent module/operator guidance, the sample settings, completion mappings and command references
accompany the implementation. No legacy execution module is deleted, no consumer is migrated and no
RunContext accessor is changed by this increment.

The SSH fixtures include synthetic process faults and actual installed OpenSSH against owned
loopback sshd. Forwarding covers binary traffic, requested-listener failures, address families,
trust/authentication/command refusal and cleanup. Enrollment covers actual first-contact writes, CA
and revocation policy, mismatch refusal, retained keys after failed authentication and strict
recovery. These are local Linux fixtures, not the supported workstation/provider matrix.

Fresh-process checks keep legacy execution unavailable during new-stack imports and config loading.
No operator credentials, trust stores, VMs or cloud resources were used in these local checks.
Fixture servers, agents, processes, listeners and temporary policy files are owned and cleaned by
the tests. Native workstation and provider cleanup need their own live observations.

## Private review disposition

Independent project, complexity and generic correctness reviews evaluated the implemented scope.
Their correction reviews are clean at `e63a1ec4`. Material findings corrected before publication of
this record included:

- Ambiguous malformed public identity/sibling fallback could select an unrelated agent key. Direct
  public identities now require no sibling; private identities verify their companion fingerprint.
- Deeply nested persisted JSON now produces typed trust refusal before dispatch.
- Forwarding acknowledgment acceptance no longer depends on pipe read boundaries.
- Ownership is retained before forwarding worker startup; interrupted startup joins the worker or
  reports bounded cleanup uncertainty while preserving the interruption.
- Enrollment flushing preserves control-flow interruption, and permanent command/settings indexes
  describe maintenance refusal and recovery accurately.

The correctness lane reproduced the identity issue with fixture-only sshd/agent credentials. The
forwarding correction was independently reproduced with a normally scheduled worker and a worker
held beyond the cleanup allowance. Mutation tests confirmed the strict enrollment follow-up,
managed-file integrity and forwarding interruption regressions detect removed safeguards.

## Windows CI correction

Hosted Windows CI at `369a1859` exposed false stable-file snapshot refusals and an enrollment test
that expected native path spelling in OpenSSH options. Code
`ee6301679a5cb61309937b6114a12785d1823d0b` corrects both. CPython 3.13.15's
[pathname query](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.15/Modules/posixmodule.c#L2073) and
[descriptor query](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.15/Python/fileutils.c#L1035) give
`ctime` different meanings on Windows. The correction keeps complete descriptor before/after
metadata checks, path device/inode/size/mtime checks and POSIX path change-time equality.

All three independent correction reviews are clean. Mutation experiments show the regressions catch
the original mismatch and removal of descriptor or pathname protection. The corrected full local
suite passed **10,433 tests with 12 skips**; full mypy and Ruff passed. All
[hosted checks](https://github.com/WayfarerLabs/agentworks/actions/runs/35468781056) passed,
including Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 and Windows Python 3.13 (**461 passed, 25 skipped**). This
establishes the correction on Windows CI; it does not supply terminal, provider or
production-composition evidence.

## Shared subprocess adoption

Integration code `1b2c683293d5cddd8390b59146fd7fe3d03bf808` rebases the SSH work onto transport
`e85e9f5c4752ae926315fa7c0e69b871de42e4fc`. SSH now uses the shared finite-input pump and cleanup,
retaining its Windows environment filter, carrier stdout and mixed stderr provenance. The
independence fixture imports `Command` from the canonical invocation models module.

The combined execution suite passed **613 tests with 5 skips**, and the full local non-integration
suite passed **10,581 tests with 12 skips**. Ruff and mypy passed, covering 939 Python files and 902
typed source files respectively. File lint, locked-SDD, rulesync and typer-isolation checks passed;
website checks passed 160 Python and 103 Node tests, and both site-base double builds were
identical. These local results do not establish native Windows/macOS or full production integration
acceptance.

## Remaining integration and acceptance

Transport [#833](https://github.com/WayfarerLabs/agentworks/pull/833), observed at
`a885ef5af256782abb827d6165cefd72a74e4e58`, supplies the shared subprocess pump adopted by SSH. Its
carrier types remain buffered-only and its live I/O LLD remains a candidate. Full live/terminal
delivery requires transport's concrete carrier/report/terminal definitions and joint proof. The
operator confirmed #833 as the implementation source, with terminal/PTY work proceeding in parallel.

SSH integration `678e487d` incorporates that transport pin and adds a standalone buffered-mode guard
for #833: unfamiliar shared input/output modes refuse before connection admission or process
creation. Current constructor checks already exclude these shapes; the guard lets transport widen
its types safely before SSH adopts them. Six simulated future-mode cases prove that boundary, not
live-mode support. A clean cherry-pick onto transport `a885ef5a` passed its client and guard tests
(53 passed, 4 skipped). The complete SSH combination passed 10,596 local tests with 12 skips, full
Ruff/format and mypy. Three independent private reviews passed the guard; removing its input and
output checks broke the corresponding four and two cases. Real widened types must be exercised when
the extension is published.

The [terminal experiment](terminal-lld.md#real-ssh-client-relay-experiment) now demonstrates why an
owned local stdin PTY is preferable to pipes for POSIX OpenSSH: geometry, resize and nondefault
modes survive while transport's bootstrap supplies the payload/interactive handoffs. It does not
implement the shared terminal API, production relay or supported-platform acceptance.

Transport's
[launch-interruption evidence](../2026-09-12-transport-improv/prior-art-research.md#local-process-startup-and-interruption)
also applies to the former SSH pump: interruption before the cleanup guard can orphan the local
child. Adoption preserves that known gap; tests of interruption inside the I/O loop cannot close it.
Shared launch ownership and SSH forwarding's corresponding startup path remain production acceptance
work.

Also outstanding are additive RunContext/platform composition, a genuine creation-flow provenance
and publication binding, complete SSH-backed workflow evidence, and supported Linux/macOS/Windows
workstation/provider observations. Native Windows trust permissions/publication and console
restoration are not established by POSIX fixtures or hosted unit tests. Existing PoC coverage
retains its recorded qualifications; it does not close new Phase 2 obligations.

The [plan](plan.md#phase-2-full-ssh-implementation-in-the-second-pr) therefore remains open, the PR
remains draft without `review-requested`, and there is no merge or full-phase acceptance claim. The
initial artifact checkpoint closed with 0 of 1 public fix rounds used. The separate allowance of up
to three implementation public feedback/fix rounds remains unused. Shared integration must be
completed before ready; final SSH deletion still waits for the later operator request and preceding
transport retirement stages.
