# Phase 1 Acceptance Evidence

- Date: 2026-08-06
- Branch: `feat/onboarding-discovery-guide`
- Environment: isolated temporary home, config, state, and fake executable directories
- Budget: 20 commands and 10 minutes for the initial pass; 8 commands and 5 minutes for the focused
  rerun

## Golden path

The initial clean-environment run reached the first actionable `concept-onboarding` plan in 113 ms.
The plan contained two inert actions and executed neither. The full disclosure preceded inventory
and actions. There were zero prompts or operator interactions.

Fifteen initial CLI invocations covered explicit human and agent modes, piped `--human`, retained
names under missing and broken configuration, live names under valid configuration, atomic
multi-topic success and failure, authored broken-config fallback, and no-topic indexes. Secret
resolution, VM connections, action execution, configuration mutation, and state mutation did not
occur.

This Phase 1 measurement intentionally stops at the first actionable guide plan. FRD acceptance
criterion 1 requires the published Claude Code and Codex bootstrap packages and a working session,
so its clean-machine timing and interaction evidence belongs to Phase 3 rather than this guide-core
slice.

## Acceptance findings and rerun

The initial run found that host-tool readiness inspected executable presence during guide registry
construction and that the no-topic index lacked its explicit onboarding entry. Both defects were
fixed and reviewed.

The focused rerun used seven CLI invocations. Each completed in 108 to 116 ms with empty stderr,
zero prompts, and no external access:

- Ordinary resource readiness changed when a fake `limactl` became available, preserving normal
  command behavior. The fake executable was never run.
- Guide output was byte-identical with `limactl` absent or present and reported host readiness as
  `unverifiable` because guide does not inspect the workstation.
- Human and agent no-topic output both placed the complete disclosure first, then `Start here` with
  `agw guide concept-onboarding --agent`, then the topic index.
- Human and agent documents were byte-identical after normalizing only their mode-specific security
  heading.

All temporary files and temporary SQLite state were removed. The tester made no repository edits.
